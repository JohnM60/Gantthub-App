GanttHub App

Getting Started

Installation - Quick Run

Clone the repo

git clone https://git.cs.usask.ca/mpk467/cmpt370.git



Run cmpt370.jar


Rebuild Exectuable
To Rebuild the .jar executable open project in Intellij by right clicking "cmpt370.iml" -> "Open with" and select Intellij. Once the project has been opened in the Intellij IDE, navigate to the top menu bar and then select "Build"->"Build Artifacts"->"cmpt370:jar"->"Build".
The newly compiled exectuable is located in "out/artifacts/cmpt370_jar."

Main Menu
On the main menu screen, there are two buttons. First one goes to projects, which you can use to manage tasks.
The second button is for resources, which you can add to a project task.

Projects window
At the top are the task options. These will be used to edit a task after it is made.
The middle section displays all tasks you have made.
Finally, the bottom section creates a task for the project.

Create a task (Bottom of projects window)
At the bottom of the projects window is a bar with fields for entering text.


Enter a descriptive title for your task, providing a quick overview of what the task is about.


Optionally, Assign a priority level to the task by entering a numerical value. A priority of 1 represents the highest priority, and as the number increases, the priority decreases.


Optionally, Provide a detailed description of the task, including any necessary information, requirements, or context that will help team members understand what needs to be done.


Optionally, assign team members to the task. This indicates who is responsible for completing the task. Assigning members helps in task delegation and clarifies roles within the team!


Once you have filled in the necessary information, click the "Add Task" button




Task options (Top of projects window)
The "Select Task ID number" text field allows you to select which task you want to edit. Simply type the ID of the task you want to select, shown in the ID field of a task, and press enter.
The checkbox "Complete this task" allows you to set a task to completed. This can only be done after all task dependencies are also complete. Clicking this will complete a task, setting the actual completed date to today's date. Unchecking it will uncomplete a task.
The "Members" button allows you to edit project members. Selecting this will create a new text window. You can exit this window by clicking the "X" button on the top right.

1. "Add a member" adds a member to the members field of the selected task.
2. "Position of member to remove" removes the member in the position specified.


The "Dependencies" button allows you to specify which tasks are dependent on other tasks.

1. "Add a task ID" creates a new dependency in the dependencies field, which is the task of the specified ID. 
2. "Enter position of task to remove" removes the dependency at the position specified.



Create a resource (Second button, or the "Add Resource to Project" in Projects)


Enter a name for the resource


Enter the total budget (in dollars) for the resource


Enter the cost per hour for the resource


Enter a description for the resource


Click "Add Resource to Project". This adds the resource to the entire project.
